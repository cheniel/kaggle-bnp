% Your team will produce a single write-up PDF document, approximately 6 pages long, and less than 8 pages. You report will describe the problem you chose to tackle and the methods you used to address it, including which model(s) you tried, how you trained them, how you selected any parameters they might require, and how they performed in on the test data. Consider including tables of performance
% of different approaches, or plots of performance used to perform model selection (i.e., parameters that control complexity). Please report your leaderboard result in your report as well.
% You are free to collaborate with other teams, including sharing ideas and even code, but please document where your predictions came from. For example, for any code you use, please say in your report who wrote the code and how it was applied (who determined the parameter settings and how, etc.) Collaboration is particularly true for learning ensembles of predictors: your teams may each supply a set of predictors, and then collaborate to learn an ensemble from the set.

% You need to submit your pdf report; without it, you can not get grades.
% You do not need to submit your code, but if you want to, please put your code in a separate zip file).
% It is like submitting an academic paper: you can submit any supplementary documents as you want, but your main paper should be self-contained and include all the information for the readers to understand your story and your results.
% In addition, I'm sure Prof. Liu mentioned in class that the project report is due Monday, March 14th at 11:59pm.
